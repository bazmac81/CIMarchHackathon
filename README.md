# Code Institute Hackathon March 2021
  
Theme: Hacking St. Patrick's Day
St. Patrick's Day is coming up, but it is going to look very different this year.
Can you come up with a website, app or other web-based idea that will help people to celebrate St Patrick's day together, while apart?
Maybe it's a festive way for friends and family to connect online. Or a shamrock-themed game that kids can play together. Or an Irish-language greeting card store.
Whatever your idea, we can't wait to see it!
