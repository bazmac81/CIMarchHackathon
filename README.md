# Code Institute Hackathon March 2021
## Team: Hack Me, I'm Irish 
  
Theme: Hacking St. Patrick's Day
St. Patrick's Day is coming up, but it is going to look very different this year. Our team suggests a simple idea of how to stay
connected even though being apart. This is an interactive website that invites users to create custom cards and send them to
their friends and family or even print or share on social media. 
  
## UX

### Project goals
The primary goal of this project was work as a team and together create a functional piece of software according to the Hackathon theme.

### Customers' goals
Main audience of this website would be diverse in age, but united in their love to Ireland. 
These are either people from Ireland or have friends/family in Ireland, as at the moment this website allows celebrating 
only St Patrick's themed postcards. 
Customers goals are:
* create unique cards and send them to their friends and/or family;
* share a general St Patrick's Day greeting on social media;
* print out a custom made post card.

This website helps the users to meet their needs because: 
* the goals stated above were taken into consideration during all stages of the development process;
* call for action buttons appear when the card is generated;
* navigation is simple, straightforward, and intuitive.
  
### Developers' goals
Developers' goals include:
* master the skills that have already bee obtained and learn something new;
* learn how to work in a team, imitating agile software development lifecycle; 
* acquire deeper knowledge of GitHub and version control;
* develop quality piece of software for their portfolios. 
Throughout the development process, the team collaborated closely, holding everyday meetings, working in pairs, 
and taking advantage of peer code review.

### User Stories
As a new visitor to the website, I want: 
* to navigate the website easily and create a greeting card;
* to be able to send and/or share the generated card.

As a return client of the salon, I want:
* to be able to find previously created cards and re-use them.
