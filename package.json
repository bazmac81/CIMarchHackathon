  "description": "Theme: Hacking St. Patrick's Day St. Patrick's Day is coming up, but it is going to look very different this year. Can you come up with a website, app or other web-based idea that will help people to celebrate St Patrick's day together, while apart? Maybe it's a festive way for friends and family to connect online. Or a shamrock-themed game that kids can play together. Or an Irish-language greeting card store. Whatever your idea, we can't wait to see it!",
